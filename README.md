# Bot Weapons and Equipment
This BLT mod allows you to choose the Team AIs weapons as well as their visual appearence via ingame menus. Weapons as well as the visual appearence like armor, masks and deployables will be synchronized with other players in your lobby that also have the mod. Keep in mind that those changes are purely cosmetic and it will not enable Bots to place deployables or tank more damage. In terms of weapons, this mod does 2 things: First of all it enables you to choose each Bots used weapon so they don't all spawn in with Car-4s or AKs. Secondly, it exchanges all the really low definition NPC weapon models with the first person weapon models the players use (or third person if you disabled HQ weapons in the video settings).

If you want to use any parts of this mod in your own project please make sure to read the license. In addition it would be nice if you notify me about it, though not required.
