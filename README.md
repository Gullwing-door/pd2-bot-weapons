# Bot Weapons and Equipment
This started out as a mod that would let you select different weapons for the team AI to use but has evolved into much more over time. With an official implementation by Overkill, it is now based around the Crew Management and improves on that with a variety of features:
* Lets you select secondary and akimbo weapons for the team AI
* Lets you choose mask sets for the team AI with character specific masks or a mask of a random pool
* Lets you select deployables the team AI will carry (only visual, not actually usable)
* Lets you select armor the team AI will wear (only visual, does not effect their survivability)
* Adds advanced options to all loadout selections like randomized gear or selection from categories
* Lets you save selected loadouts as character specific so a certain character will always show up with their selected gear independend of character priority
* Fixes the Team AI weapon balance by taking into account magazine and burst size and gives single fire weapon their correct ROF
* All the selected team AI gear will perfectly sync to other clients (deployables only to clients also using this mod)
* Enables the random shirt feature for Sangres as a team AI
