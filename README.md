# Bot Weapons and Equipment
This BLT mod allows you to choose the Team AIs weapons as well as their visual appearence via ingame menus. Weapons as well as the visual appearence like armor, masks and deployables will be synchronized with other players in your lobby (deployables are only visible to people also using the mod). Keep in mind that most of the changes are purely cosmetic and it will not enable Bots to place deployables or tank more damage. This mod will allow you to choose from your secondary and akimbo weapons in the crew management screen, add some advanced selection options to mask and weapon selection as well as fix some vanilla NPC weapon bugs.

If you want to use any parts of this mod in your own project please make sure to read the license. In addition it would be nice if you notify me about it.
